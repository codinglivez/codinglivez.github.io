			<h1>Dear Tanvee.....</h1>
			<p>...Hello, I think we are far apart from each other from 1 and a half year or so and I feel that distance very well. I don't know when we will meet again but still I admire you a lot and I really Miss You. I miss that sharp mind whenever I am participating in any contest, someone to tell me "Aree jevat jaa re🤦🏻‍♂️" and someone who helps me in making decisions. On this Raksha Bandhan here's reminding you that I am just a call away. You and I may be far, but there's nothing that can keep us apart. I know I am a bit wierd when it comes to speaking but I'm kind of loner guess so. Very much Thanks to you who taught me what a sister means in life. You are a gem; I just pray to God to give you long life and abundant happiness. Thank you so much for helping and supporting me throughout. I am very grateful to God for having you as my sister. I hope I don't loose you in time 😥. 
			I will always be there for you whenever you need me in any time or place or circumstances as I don't think there is any person I know as important as you are to me. My Life is what it is because of you.. Happy Raksha Bandhan 💖💝 </p><br>
